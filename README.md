# Tapply Coding Challenge: Frontend

Welcome to our frontend coding challenge. In this exercise, you'll create a responsive web app that asks users a series of questions and display their responses on the screen as the questions progress. Here we have an example of one of our intern's completed challenge. [Demo](https://rpgmaker.netlify.app/)

This exercise is designed to give you unlimited creative freedom as you develop a solution/implementation. Feel free to use any frameworks/packages/tools as you see fit; the goal is a functional app with a reasonable amount of CSS stylings. Backend implementation is not required.

Since we use Next.js as our frontend framework, we've included it as part of the repo; if you wish to use it, here's a good [starting point](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app).

# Tapply Setup

This repo holds a basic prototype for a signup prompt for Tapply. It asks users for their name, their position, their interests/areas of help, and then generates a sample bio, which the user can edit, based on their responses. This project was built using Next.js and CSS.
